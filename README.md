# CS 170: Introduction to Computer Science I

This is my class notes on the course **CS 170** at Emory University. The full name of this course is **Introduction to Computer Science I**. This course focuses on learning the basics of computer science by introducing Java and Linux Operating system. It is a sequence course at the CS Department; the sequent course is CS 170, Introduction to Computer Science II, focusing on introducing algorithm analysis.

## Course description

An introduction to Computer Science for students expecting to utilize serious computing in coursework, research, or employment. Emphasis is on computing concepts, programming principles, algorithm development and basic data structures, using the Java programming language and the Unix operating system. No previous computer science knowledge is expected or necessary. With the exception of AP Computer Science A, students with any prior exposure to CS should still begin with this course, which is the first in a sequence for CS majors.

Students completing this course successfully will be able to 
- (1) design simple computer algorithms; 
- (2) program these using the Java language; 
- (3) understand the core elements of imperative programming; 
- (4) execute, test, and document programs; 
- (5) know when and how to use simple variables, 1-d and 2-d arrays; 
- (6) understand and program simple recursive algorithms; and 
- (7) know how to detect errors in programs, use debugging tools, and effectively correct bugs.
